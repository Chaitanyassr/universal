AcceptanceTests_untrustedSettingsPut.js

Description:
This is a series of tests using the online flowmanager to test the /untrusted-settings PUT endpoint that GPII app installations use to update user preferences. Before updating preferences, the GPII app installation must request an access tokens from GPII Cloud using OAuth2 resource owner GPII token grant. This access token is then sent along with the update request to represent the authorization of the GPII app installation to user preferences.

Requirements:
Since it's using the online flowmanager, there are NO REQUIREMENTS to the system other than the GPII being installed (and able to run in local 'cloudBased' flowmanager mode).
