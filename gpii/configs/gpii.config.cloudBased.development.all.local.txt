gpii.config.cloudBased.development.all.local.json
=================================================

This configuration runs the entire system as a cloudBased flowmanager, but with everything locally and in development mode.

This mean that:
* The storage for user preferences is on the local filesystem (as opposed to couchDB servers/remote URLs)
* The storage for the authentication data is stored locally in a pouchDB
* The following components are running on the local machine:
** authServer
** canopyMatchMaker
** flowManager
** matchMakerFramework
** OntologyHandler
** pouchManager
** preferencesServer
** solutionsRegistry (reading registry from file)

Note that this setup incorrectly derives from the deviceReporter development config. This is because of a dependency error in the system design where the cloudBased flowManager still attempts to query the platform deviceReporter rather than recognising that it is on platform "web" - e.g. within BrowserChannel.js
This setup also runs the pouch manager locally for the data persistence in order to serve data for the preferences server and the auth server.
