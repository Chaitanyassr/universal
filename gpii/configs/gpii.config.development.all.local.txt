gpii.config.development.all.local.json
======================================

This configuration runs the entire system locally and in development mode.

This mean that:
* All storage is on the local filesystem (as opposed to couchDB servers/remote URLs)
* The following components are running on the local machine:
** canopyMatchMaker
** deviceReporter (reading device context info from file)
** flowManager
** lifecycleManager
** matchMakerFramework
** OntologyHandler
** pouchManager
** preferencesServer
** solutionsRegistry (reading registry from file)

Note that this setup runs the pouch manager locally locally for the data persistence in order to serve data for the preferences server.
