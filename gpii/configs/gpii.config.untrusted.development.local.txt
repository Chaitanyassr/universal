gpii.config.untrusted.development.local.json
============================================

This configuration runs the entire system locally under the hybrid Flow Manager architecture and in development mode.

* The Untrusted Flow Manager runs on port 8081
* The Cloud Based Flow Manager runs on port 8084

* The following components are running on the local machine:
** Untrusted Flow Manager
*** deviceReporter
*** flowManager (untrusted, browser channel)

** Cloud Based Flow Manager
*** authServer
*** canopyMatchMaker
*** flowManager (cloud based oauth2)
*** preferencesServer
*** solutionsRegistry
