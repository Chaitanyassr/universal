gpii.preferencesServer.config.base.json
=======================================

This configuration adds the preferences server as a subcomponent to the flow manager. It also configs the dbDataStore used by the preferences server.

Note that this configuration is mainly used by other configurations that requires the preferences server running locally since the preferences server is by default a subcomponent of the cloud based flow manager but not the local flow manager running on local machines.
