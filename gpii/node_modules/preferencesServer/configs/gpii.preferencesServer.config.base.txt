gpii.preferencesServer.config.base.json
=======================================

This configuration adds the preferences server as a subcomponent to the flow manager. It also configs the dbDataStore used by the preferences server.

Note that this configuration is mainly used by other configurations that require the preferences server running locally. Also by default, the preferences server is a subcomponent of the cloud based flow manager but not a subcomponent of the local flow manager running on local machines.
