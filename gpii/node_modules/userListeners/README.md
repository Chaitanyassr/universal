# User listeners

## RFID Listener

* Uses [@pokusew/pcsclite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pokusew/pcsclite) to access the card reader.
  This has build dependencies on Linux, which prevents it being tested easily in CI, so the actual reference to this package is in gpii-windows.
* Cards supported:
  * Mifare Classic 1k and 4k
  * NTAG203/213/216
  * Mifare Ultralight.
