# Card Tests

These tests are not performed by CI - they operate on a real card.

Requirements:
* A card reader (and card).
* Run inside gpii-windows, or npm install @pokusew/pcsclite.

Scripts:
* `real-card-tests.js` performs the following tests:
    * Detect card type.
    * Get the token from the card.
* `record.js` Records the transaction of retrieving a token from the card, outputting json that can be placed in
[cards.json5](../testData/cards.json5). These transactions are used to mock cards, in the unit tests.
