Process Reporter
===

A server app built deployed with a node.js server that returns process information.

### Process Reporter API

The app currently supports the following urls:

    {urlToProcessReporterServer}/processes            // GET ONLY
    {urlToProcessReporterServer}/processes/{solution} // GET ONLY

The first form cycles through the solutions registry, and for each entry, determines if the associated processes are running.  The second form reports only the solution requested, for example:

    {urlToProcessReporterServer}/processes/org.gnome.desktop.a11y.magnifier

In both cases, the Process Reporter uses the information stored in the `isRunning` block of a solutions registry entry.  For example, the `isRunning` block for the Orca screen reader (the solution entry `org.gnome.orca`) is as
follows:
```
"isRunning": [
    {
        "type": "gpii.processReporter.find",
        "command": "orca"
    }
]
```

The payload returned is an array of solutions and their run state, followed by the platform:
```
{
    "solutions": [
        {
            "id": "org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications",
            "running": true
        },
        {
            "id": "org.gnome.orca",
            "running": false
        },
        ...
    ],
    "OS":
    {
        "id": "linux",
        "version": "4.5.7-300.fc24.x86-64"
}}
```

If the status of only one solution is requested, then the payload is information about that solution:

```
{
    "solutions":
    {
        "id": "org.gnome.orca",
        "running":false
    },
    "OS":
    {
        "id": "linux",
        "version": "4.5.7-300.fc24.x86-64"
    }
}
```
